                    <p >Static sign content will wear out the consumer with its non-changing presentation.  In fact, you typically are limited to brand marking only. Digital signage constantly delivers new content. In addition, you can tailor your message to multiple target demographics.   In addition, your message can be easily scheduled to deliver content according to the time of the day or time of year. Outdoor digital signage offers real-time advertising and information.</p>

                    <p class="para-desc">Outdoor digital signage may be more expensive upfront than a static sign, but in the long run it generally delivers a positive Return-On-Investment (ROI).  Only two things increase your revenue stream: salespeople and advertising.  Tailoring the content for your specific target market is key to increasing sales. Changing the message on the screen does not involve any additional labor cost.  The effort to change traditional static signs is considerable. Digital signage has no print costs, no waste produced from thrown out signage, and no employees on ladders to change out static signage. </p>
