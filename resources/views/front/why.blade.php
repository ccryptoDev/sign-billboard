                    <p class="para-desc">All your advertising on TV, radio, print, and online media is fragmented. How? All these “Channels” are designed to align with a very narrow target demographics. The unintended result is that also limits your ability to reach a larger group of people.</p>
                    <p class="para-desc">On the other hand, Outdoor Advertising remains the only true mass medium since it gets seen by everyone. Did you know that the average person spends 17% of their waking hours in a car? Almost one-fifth of their time is spent looking at signs along the road. In addition, Outdoor advertising doesn‟t get interrupted like TV, radio, and mobile ads. It also cannot be affected by ad fraud, ad skipping, ad blocking tech, and the low „viewability‟ rates plaguing online and mobile advertising.</p>

                    <p class="para-desc">Why is that important? The old static signs „disappear‟ to the public after the 17th to 20th time people pass them. Digital signs constantly change – attracting their eye constantly. There truly is no missing them.</p>
                    <p class="para-desc">More importantly you can tailor multiple Ads to target specific kinds of people. You can deliver Ads directed expressly at young people, middle-aged women, older men, high income, motorcyclists, etc. The response rate is much higher than just some generic ad that tries to address everyone.</p>
