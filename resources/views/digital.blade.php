                        </ul>
                        <p class="top15">We are not talking about the actual cost.   The value of your sign is based on your location and how well it attracts new customers – meaning how it helps sales. Most businesses see an 10-50% increase in business for customers who purchase a new outdoor sign.   </p>

                    <h4 class="text-capitalize darkcolor top20 text-center text-md-left">Any Sign should have a strong Return-On-Investment. </h4>
                    <p class="top15">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  A digital sign typically increases in-store traffic bt 10-30%.  Ticket size is generally 115% of normal ticket sale size. <br> </p>
                    <p class="top15">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. If your business grosses $1,000,000 per year in sales, and you increase it to $1,100,000 (a conservative 10% increase in sales), at a 15% profit margin you have made an additional $15,000 per year. That is $1,250 per month. If you bought $40,000 sign, the loan is $424 (5% note over a ten years) or $748 (5% note over five years). You are already making additional cash flow. That is payback is 32 months! Note that your sign will continue to make you money even after it is paid off.</p>
                    <h4 class="text-capitalize darkcolor top20 text-center text-md-left">Compare the cost to other forms of advertising.  </h4>
                    <p class="top15">When measuring marketing costs, advertisers use cost per thousand (CPM).  CPM is the cost of a media exposure reaching 1,000 potential buyers.  Advertising studies state that a typical outdoor business sign costs less than 30 cents to reach 1,000 people. In contrast, the CPM for ads on TV range from $10 to $25 depending on the program all the way up to $56 CPM for direct mail! The biggest difference between your on-premises lighted sign and other forms of advertising is that you pay for a new sign one time. After that, it still continues to work 7 days a week for many years. 
                        A great sign with the right images is a salesperson who is always working, never sick, and makes you money 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for years to come. </p>

                        <p class="top15">All sizes of Digital signs are created by using one or more cabinets (in rows and columns). This approach allows you to create a custom sized sign of any size.  In general terms, digital signs are categorized by Outdoor or Indoor, LED size, and maintenance access.</p>
                        <div class="col-lg-12">
                            <aside class="sidebar">

                                    <!-- <h4 class="text-capitalize darkcolor bottom20">Categories</h4> -->
                                    <span class="bottom25"><a>Outdoor / Indoor: Why designate whether a sign is Outdoor or Indoor? It changes the type of cabinet that the manufacturer uses. Manufacturers like to classify Outdoor cabinets as IP65 while Indoor are normally IP30 to IP50.  The first number indicates dust resistance, the second is water resistance. For example, IP44 indicates dust resistant, splash resistant, while IP65 normally means dust-proof and wash-down capable.  The manufacturers’ designations are not actually correct.   Dust gets into the Outdoor cabinets.  They are not actually sealed against that issue.  The cabinets are water resistant, not waterproof.  It is possible for water to get inside, though not highly likely.  In any case, your biggest enemy for Outdoor or Indoor signs are dust and condensation from humidity. 
                                    Simple maintenance programs can limit these issues dramatically.   For example, use an air compressor about once a quarter to blow out the accumulated dust.</a></span>

Most companies designate their sizes using a “P” (for Pitch) and the physical size (in millimeters).   For example, they are called P10 or P6 or P4.   The size of the LED really drives the cost of the sign (covered later). </a></span>

                                The size of the sign is one of THE two most important factors in its effectiveness (the second is what marketing agencies call the Creative or the Ads you post on the sign).  How do you decide what the right size is?   In either case, you need to understand the minimum and maximum distance the sign will be read.   Use these general rules for your selection: 
                            </p>
                            <ul class="commment">
                                <li><h5 style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd">First Rule: Figure out the size of text you need.    </h5></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="top15">
                                We cannot emphasize this point enough.   The text size controls the screen size.   You do NOT choose the sign size and then fit the text in it.  You figure out the required text size and then ‘wrap’ the size of the sign around it. <br>
                                The primary purpose of an effective sign is readability. From years of study, it has been determined that the recommended minimum reading time is 3-5 seconds.  What size letter will your sign require to allow for sufficient readability of your message before you have driven passed it?  <br>
                            </p>
                            <p class="top15">
                                The right size means the text must be legible --- at the right distance from the sign.  For text to legible, the font must be 1 inch high for every 10 feet away the viewer stands. Consider this point: If you bought a 2 ft high x 6 ft wide display, and you need text that is 10 inches tall, the text takes up 40% of the sign’s entire height.  Hmm.   That sign is too small.   Get the point?

                                But is that the whole answer?   No.  That information only covers the typical distance you need people to be able to read a sign.   Now you must include the speed of the road.  So now that you know the text influences the sign size, use our Speed App to calculate the text size needed.  But to do that correctly, you need to define how far away your customers will be reading the sign.

                            Why is this part important?   The Pitch size figures closely with how close your viewer can be and still see a good picture.  For example, look at a gas station price sign.   From a distance, it will look like the perfectly formed digit.  When you get closer, you can see all the dots that make of the image.  Why.  They maybe P20 or P16.  Not only are they large sized LEDs but they are spaced widely also.  But in this case, they are perfect for their design.  The viewer sees the price from a good distance and has time to make the decision to stop at that gas station. 
                            <br>
                            Can you use this same sized LEDs for people 40 feet away? Nope.   It will look like a mess.

                            Use our catalog to give you an idea of the right Pitch size.  In general, use the minimum distance to determine the right Pitch that you need.

                            So now you know the right size of the sign you need and the right Pitch for the LEDs.   That pretty much tells you everything you need to determine the cost (without the stand it is on or the frame holding it or the installation cost).

                            While hearing the cost of an outdoor business sign cost might seem high, an effective sign will generate more revenue than it costs.  Your business needs a sign.  The real question is “what I an effective sign?” 
                            <br>
                            You want the best Return-On-Investment for your money.  This purchase is not just an expense, like a vehicle or even your building. Vehicles do not increase your sales.  This sign purchase has one sole function - to increase sales.  Every business needs a marketing plan.  Your marketing plan includes advertising.  Advertising increases sales. 
                            <br>
                            What is the most effective sign to increase your sales?  An unlit sign?  A neon backlit sign?  A Flex sign using LED light bulbs?  Or a digital sign?  Clearly an illuminated sign is best, capturing the attention of customers driving by.  But that sign needs to be capturing their interest in six months, in six years. 
                            <br>
                            Make sure you ask the installer about the sign’s size , materials, labor costs, wind load design, local ordinance requirements (permits), and projected lifespan of the sign.  Regardless of the type of sign, free-standing signs vary from $150 to $400 per square foot depending on complexity (installed).  The cost per square foot goes up with complexity, but actually goes down with size, a counterintuitive idea.

                        <h4 class="text-capitalize darkcolor top20 text-center text-md-left">Can outdoor business sign cost be financed?  </h4>
                        <p class="top15">Most outdoor commercial signs can be financed by a leasing or financing company. For example, a $15,000 dollar sign might be financed over 60 months with a total payment of approximately $325/mo. with a $1 buyout at the end. A $40,000 sign over 60 months is $830/mo.  The marketing effects of new outdoor signage are achieved immediately while the only cost is the first two payments up front.   If you need financing, let us know.  We can provide three finance companies for you to contact.  They usually require you to be in business for 2 ½ years minimum.  You normally get approval inside one day with these folks. </p>
